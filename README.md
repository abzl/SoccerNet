SoccerNet

Project Description
---------------------------
SoccerNet is a website built with React and Airtable that allows soccer fans to follow their favorite soccer teams through the most prestigious cup in Europe, the Champions League. Users will be able to see replays, fixtures and leave comments. From the home page, the user will be able to select his/her favorite team from a dropdown menu located in the middle of the page. The page will show the score for the match the user selected along with a link to see highlights. Finally, the user may choose to leave a message to support his/her team.

* Strengths: I have good understanding of what I want in this application. 
* Weaknesses: Implementing the route component.
* Opportunities: A lot of practice, review and implementation of all tecnologies learned recently.
* Threats: Whenever I get stuck with an issue or error, I spent too much time trying to find a solution. I need to learn when to stop and when I need to look for help.
